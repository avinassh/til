I took a [masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0N-z0H8VEU) on writing, and here are some things I learned.

## Start

When you start to write, think of three things:

- Reaction - how the reader will react to the writing
- Action - what action do you want them to take once they've read it (e.g., subscribe to a newsletter, share on social media, buy a product, etc.)
- Takeaway - can they have a one-sentence, meaningful takeaway?

Start with the title and subtitle because that's how you catch someone's attention. Then comes the first sentence. The most promising, provocative, or hook should be the first sentence. The first two sentences should make the reader want to read the next two. The next two should make the reader want to read the next three, and so on.

## Simplicity

Avoid fluff. 

Write in simple words. Write as you talk. Avoid unnecessary jargon, fluff, or bullshit words. Writing should be simple and sincere. Write as you talk. 

Don't use words that make the reader think of a dictionary. Use apps like Hemingway and target your writing for 7th graders. The lower, the better.

Voice Memo Test: Send the article as a voice note to your friend. If you wouldn't want to talk about it with your friends, then don't bother writing it either.

## Style

Prefer informal to formal writing. It's easier to connect with users that way. (obvious) Avoid monotonous, long sentences.

Writing has a rhythm. Write like music. - Gary Provost

Don't use only short sentences or long sentences. Use a combination of both.
