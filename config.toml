  # By default, this theme displays dates with a format like "02 Jan, 2006", but
  # you can customize it by setting the `dateFormat` param in your site's config
  # file. See [Hugo's Format function docs](https://gohugo.io/functions/format/)
  # for details. An example TOML config that uses [ISO
  # 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format:
  # dateFormat = "2006-01-02"
